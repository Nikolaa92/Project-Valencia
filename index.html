      <h2>About me</h2>
      <article>
        <p>I’m a proud father to a lively 2-year-old daughter and currently work in the tech support department of a telecom company. I began my college education in my home country but decided to continue my studies in a field I’m truly passionate about. I’m now pursuing an AS in Computer Programming and Analytics at <a href="https://valenciacollege.edu/"> Valencia College,</a> where I’m enrolled in three classes this semester.</p>
        <p>I have some prior programming experience, having completed a JavaScript bootcamp and working as a full stack software engineer on an open-source project called Skyscraper. My professional interests center on cloud computing and the ServiceNow platform, and I’m eager to grow my expertise in these areas.</p>
        <p>Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn, GitHub, or through my Portfolio .</p>
